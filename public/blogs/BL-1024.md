# Amazon Key Management Service (KMS): A Comprehensive Guide with Hands-On Lab

Cryptography is the practice of converting information into secret code to ensure confidentiality and privacy. It plays a vital role in securing digital communications by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Key functions of cryptography include authentication, data integrity, and nonrepudiation, with encryption serving as its central mechanism.

Encryption transforms readable data into an unreadable format, making it accessible only to those with the proper decryption key. This process ensures that information remains protected from unauthorized individuals, safeguarding sensitive data in various applications, from secure messaging to financial transactions. As the digital landscape evolves, encryption continues to be a cornerstone of cybersecurity, enabling organizations and individuals to protect their information from potential threats.

Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and control cryptographic keys used to encrypt data. It is a critical component of AWS's security and compliance offerings, enabling organizations to protect sensitive data, meet regulatory requirements, and implement robust encryption strategies. In this article, we’ll dive deep into Amazon KMS, explore its features, and walk through a hands-on lab to demonstrate its capabilities. We’ll also include facts, statistics, and expert insights to provide a well-rounded understanding of the service.

## 3. Amazon KMS in Action: A Hands-On Lab

In this lab, we’ll walk through the process of creating a KMS key, encrypting and decrypting data, and integrating KMS with an AWS service (S3).

Objectives:
- Create an AWS KMS encryption key
- Install the AWS Encryption CLI
- Encrypt plaintext
- Decrypt ciphertext

### Lab Setup
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - An AWS account.
   - Basic knowledge of AWS services (IAM, S3).
   - AWS CLI installed and configured.

2. **Step 1: Create a KMS Key**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
    ![kms](/BL-10244/278-1.png)
   - Navigate to **KMS > Customer managed keys > Create key**.
    ![kms-create](/BL-10244/278-2.png)
   - Choose **Symmetric** as the key type.
    ![kms-keytype](/BL-10244/278-3.png)

    ![kms-finish](/BL-10244/278-7.png)
    ![kms-finish](/BL-10244/278-8.png)


3. **Step 2: Configure the File Server instance** 
   - Before you can encrypt and decrypt data, you need to set up a few things. To use your AWS KMS key, you will configure AWS credentials on the File Server EC2 instance. After that, you will install the AWS Encryption CLI (aws-encryption-cli), which you can use to run encrypt and decrypt commands.
   - The AWS credentials file is used to store authentication details for accessing AWS services securely via the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface), SDKs, and other AWS tools. It eliminates the need to manually enter credentials for every request and ensures secure access to AWS resources.
    
   - In the console, enter EC2 in the search  bar, and then choose EC2.
    ![ec2](/BL-10244/278-11.png)
   - In the Instances list, select the check box next for the instance you wish to connect to, in this case I have a File server instance, and then choose Connect. 
    ![ec2](/BL-10244/278-22.png)
   - Choose the mathod of connection e.g Session Manager, and then choose Connect.
    ![ec2](/BL-10244/278-33.png)
   - To change to the home directory and create the AWS credentials file, run the following commands:
        ```bash
        cd ~
        aws configure
        ```
        ![ec2](/BL-10244/278-44.png)
   - To open the AWS credentials file, run the following command:
        ```bash
        vi ~/.aws/credentials
        ```
        ![ec2](/BL-10244/278-55.png)

        This is an example of a credentials file structure:
        ```ini
        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = AKIAEXAMPLE123456
        aws_secret_access_key = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890

        [dev]
        aws_access_key_id = AKIADEVEXAMPLE98765
        aws_secret_access_key = zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba0987654321
        region = us-west-2

        ```
    - To install the AWS Encryption CLI and set your path, run the following commands:
        ```bash
        pip3 install aws-encryption-sdk-cli
        export PATH=$PATH:/home/ssm-user/.local/bin 
        ```
    
4. **Step 3: Encrypt and Decrypt Data Using the KMS Key**
   - Use the AWS CLI to encrypt a plaintext file:
     ```bash
     aws kms encrypt --key-id <your-key-id> --plaintext fileb://plaintext.txt --output text --query CiphertextBlob > encrypted.txt
     ```
   - Decrypt the encrypted file:
     ```bash
     aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://encrypted.txt --output text --query Plaintext > decrypted.txt
     ```

    - To create the text file, run the following commands:

        ```bash
        touch secret1.txt secret2.txt secret3.txt
        echo 'TOP SECRET 1!!!' > secret1.txt
        ```
    - To view the contents of the secret1.txt file, run the following command:

        ```bash
        cat secret1.txt
        ```
    - To create a directory to output the encrypted file, run the following command:

        ```bash 
        mkdir output
        ```
    - You can encrypt your data using the following script. You need an ARN for this method.

        >A KMS ARN (Amazon Resource Name) is a unique identifier for an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key. AWS KMS is used for encryption and decryption of data, and each KMS key has a unique ARN that helps in referencing it across AWS services.

        >Navigate to AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
        Click on "Customer managed keys" (or "AWS managed keys" if applicable).
        Select the key you need.
        The Key ARN will be displayed in the Key details section.
    - First run the command below by replacing the words in the brackets with your ARN
        ```bash 
            keyArn=(Your KMS ARN)
        ```
    - To encrypt the secret1.txt file, we run the following command:

        ```bash
        aws-encryption-cli --encrypt \
                        --input secret1.txt \
                        --wrapping-keys key=$keyArn \
                        --metadata-output ~/metadata \
                        --encryption-context purpose=test \
                        --commitment-policy require-encrypt-require-decrypt \
                        --output ~/output/. 
        ```
   - Below is an explanation of each line:
    >- The first line encrypts the file contents. The command uses the `--encrypt` parameter to specify the operation and the --input parameter to indicate the file to encrypt.
   >- The `--wrapping-keys` parameter, and its required key attribute, tell the command to use the AWS KMS key that is represented by the key ARN.
   >- The` --metadata-output` parameter is used to specify a text file for the metadata about the encryption operation.
   >- As a best practice, the command uses the `--encryption-context` parameter to specify an encryption context. 
   >- The `–-commitment-policy` parameter is used to specify that the key commitment security feature should be used to encrypt and decrypt.
   >- The value of the `--output `parameter, ~/output/., tells the command to write the output file to the output directory.

   - To determine whether the command succeeded, run the following command:

        ```bash
        echo $?
        ```
    If the command succeeded, the value of **$? is 0**. If the command failed, the value is nonzero.

    - To view the newly encrypted file location, run the following command:

        ```bash
        ls output
        ```
    >The encryption and decryption process takes data in plaintext, which is readable and     understandable, and manipulates its form to create ciphertext, which is what you are now seeing.
    >When data has been transformed into ciphertext, the plaintext becomes inaccessible until it's decrypted.

    ![symetric-enc](/BL-10244/Symmetric_Key_Encryption.png)
    This diagram shows how encryption works with symmetric keys and algorithms. A symmetric key and algorithm are used to convert a plaintext message into ciphertext.

    - To decrypt the file, run the following commands:
        ```bash
        aws-encryption-cli --decrypt \
                        --input secret1.txt.encrypted \
                        --wrapping-keys key=$keyArn \
                        --commitment-policy require-encrypt-require-decrypt \
                        --encryption-context purpose=test \
                        --metadata-output ~/metadata \
                        --max-encrypted-data-keys 1 \
                        --buffer \
                        --output .
        ```
    - To view the new file location, run the following command:

        ```bash
        ls
        ```
    
    The **secret1.txt.encrypted.decrypted** file contains the decrypted contents from the **secret1.txt.encrypted** file.

    - To view the contents of the decrypted file, run the following command:

        ```bash
        cat secret1.txt.encrypted.decrypted
        ```
    After successful decryption, you can now see the original plaintext contents of the **secret1.txt**.
    ![symetric-decryption](/BL-10244/Symmetric_Key_Decryption.png)
     This diagram shows how the same secret key and symmetric algorithm from the encryption process are used to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext.
