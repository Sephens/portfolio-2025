## 1. What is Linux? {#1.-What-is-Linux}
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since grown into a robust ecosystem supported by a global community of developers. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for servers, cloud computing, and development environments.

### Key Features of Linux: {#Key-Features-of-Linux}
1. **Open Source**: Linux is free to use, modify, and distribute.
2. **Multi-User and Multi-Tasking**: Multiple users can run multiple processes simultaneously.
3. **Security**: Linux has robust user permissions and built-in security features.
4. **Customizability**: Users can customize Linux to suit their needs.

## 2. Why is Linux Important for AWS and Cloud Computing? {#2.-Why-is-Linux-Important-for-AWS-and-Cloud-Computing}
Linux is the backbone of many cloud computing platforms, including AWS. Here’s why Linux is essential for cloud professionals:

* **AWS Infrastructure**: Many AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, use Linux-based operating systems by default.
* **Cost-Effective**: Linux is free, reducing the cost of running cloud infrastructure.
* **Automation:** Linux supports scripting and automation, which are critical for managing cloud resources.
* **Compatibility**: Most cloud tools and frameworks are designed to work seamlessly with Linux.
* **Security & Permissions**: Linux provides robust security through file permissions and user management.

For example, when you launch an Amazon EC2 instance, you can choose from a variety of Linux-based AMIs (Amazon Machine Images), such as Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or CentOS.

* Amazon Linux – Optimized for AWS workloads.
* Ubuntu – Popular for cloud applications.
* CentOS/RHEL – Enterprise-grade server OS.
* Debian – Known for stability and security.

## 3. Key Concepts in Linux {#3.-Key-Concepts-in-Linux}

### File System Hierarchy {#File-System-Hierarchy}
Linux organizes files in a hierarchical directory structure. Here are some key directories:

* /: The root directory.
* /home: Contains user home directories.
* /etc: Stores configuration files.
* /var: Contains variable data like logs.
* /bin: Contains essential binary files (executables).

### Users and Permissions {#Users-and-Permissions}
Linux is a multi-user system, and each user has specific permissions to access files and directories. Permissions are divided into three categories:

* Owner: The user who owns the file.
* Group: Users belonging to a specific group.
* Others: All other users.

Example

```
# Check file permissions
ls -l /home/user/file.txt

# Change file permissions
chmod 755 /home/user/file.txt  # Owner: read/write/execute, Group/Others: read/execute
```
### Processes and Services {#Processes-and-Services}
Linux runs processes in the background (daemons) to manage services like web servers, databases, and networking.

Example:

```
# List running processes
ps aux

# Start a service
sudo systemctl start apache2  # Start Apache web server

```

## 4. Real-Life Examples of Linux in AWS {#4.-Real-Life-Examples-of-Linux-in-AWS}

#### Example 1 Launching an EC2 Instance with Amazon Linux {#Example-1-Launching-an-EC2-Instance-with-Amazon-Linux}
When you launch an EC2 instance, you can choose an Amazon Linux AMI. Once the instance is running, you can connect to it via SSH and manage it using Linux commands.

```
# Connect to an EC2 instance
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<ip address of instance>

```

#### Example 2 Automating Backups with a Linux Script {#Example-2-Automating-Backups-with-a-Linux-Script}
You can use a Linux script to automate backups of your EC2 instance data to an S3 bucket.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
BACKUP_DIR="/home/ec2-user/backups"
S3_BUCKET="s3://my-backup-bucket"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Create backup
tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE.tar.gz /var/www/html

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp $BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE.tar.gz $S3_BUCKET

echo "Backup completed and uploaded to S3."

```

## 5. Basic Linux Commands and Scripts {#5.-Basic-Linux-Commands-and-Scripts}
Here are some essential Linux commands and a sample script to get you started:

Common Commands

```
# Navigate directories
cd /home/user

# List files
ls -la

# Create a file
touch file.txt

# Create a directory
mkdir /home/ec2-user/backups

# Edit a file
nano file.txt
vi file2.txt
vim file3.txt

# View file content
cat file.txt

# copy files
cp /var/log/myapp.log /home/ec2-user/backups/

# Delete files and directories
rm /home/ec2-user/backups/myapp.log
rm -rf /home/backups

# Search for text in a file
grep "search-term" file.txt

# Compress files
tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /var/www/html

# Check disk usage
df -h

```

Example of a sript to monitor Disk Usage in AWS

```
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
THRESHOLD=90  # Disk usage threshold in percentage

# Check disk usage
DISK_USAGE=$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed 's/%//g')

# Compare with threshold
if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then
    echo "Disk usage is above $THRESHOLD%. Current usage: $DISK_USAGE%"
else
    echo "Disk usage is within limits. Current usage: $DISK_USAGE%"
fi

```

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}
